Overview
This repository contains a business analytics dashboard built for ElectroHub to analyze and visualize sales data. The dashboard provides key insights into product performance, sales trends, and the relationship between sales, profit, and other relevant business metrics. It also offers interactive features to explore data by product, time period, city, and more.

Key Features
1. Top/Bottom 5 Products by Sales/Profit/Quantity Sold
This feature ranks the top and bottom 5 products based on their sales, profit, and quantity sold.
Users can toggle between different metrics to see which products perform best and worst in each category.
2. Sales Trends Over Time (Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Annually)
Visualize how sales have evolved over different time periods (daily, monthly, quarterly, and annually).
Analyze peaks and dips in sales performance to identify seasonal trends, growth patterns, or other time-based insights.
3. Sales vs Profit Relationship
Explore the relationship between sales and profit through scatter plots and correlation metrics.
This helps understand whether higher sales consistently translate to higher profits, or if other factors (e.g., discounts) affect profit margins.
4. Compare Sales/Profit/Quantity Sold Between Two Periods
Users can select any two custom time periods to compare sales, profit, and quantity sold side by side.
This feature allows users to quickly spot differences in performance between time periods, e.g., comparing two months, quarters, or promotional campaigns.
5. Average Discount by Category
This feature calculates the average discount offered in each discount category, enabling users to understand how discount strategies vary across different product lines or promotional categories.
Insights into whether higher discounts are translating into increased sales or affecting profit margins.
6. Total Number of Orders
A summary of the total number of orders placed, providing an overview of transaction volume.
This can be broken down by time periods or filtered by other dimensions such as product, city, or customer.
7. Detailed Order View
A detailed view of sales, profit, discount, net sales, and other relevant fields for each order.
Users can filter this information by Product, Date, Customer ID, or Promotion Category using visual filters.
8. Sales by City
Visualize sales performance across different cities to determine geographical patterns.
This helps identify which regions are driving the most revenue and where there may be opportunities for growth.
